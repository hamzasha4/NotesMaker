<h1 style="text-align:center;" data-placeholder="Start Writing!">Surah Baqrah</h1><h5>Background</h5><p>Madni Surah (Revealed over a span of many years)<br>The last two duas was given to the Prophet S.A.W at miraj.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ayah - 1<br>الٓمٓ<br>Alif, Lam, Meem</p><p>The Prophet (S.A.W) was unlettered, So when he S.A.W recites these letters it sends shockwave to the community that he S.A.W has got a teacher from whom he (S.A.W) is learning and He is Allah.</p><p>Unprecented usage, Quran uses terms and ways that have been never heard and used before. This creates a curiosity that the teacher is someone from whom no one has learned before.</p><p>It is wrong to say that these letters have no meaning before everything Allah says has a meaning. So, it should have a benefit for us. This can be thought of as a orientation that we can't understand everything. It creates for us an attitude that we don't understand everything and Allah knows everything. Even if we don't understand something then it is limitation of our knowledge.</p><p>We should not bring our consumer attitude to the Quran. We come to the Quran as a begger, as a desperation for guidance. So it is very important that we come to the Quran with the right attitutde.</p><p>If Allah does not tell you certain things then it is useful for us. Because not all curiosity is good for you.</p><p>One more point that whenever we see such letters, then we see mention of Quran next to it. Like Allah reminds of the same attitude again and again.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ayah - 2<br>ذَٰلِكَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبُ لَا رَيۡبَۛ فِيهِۛ هُدٗى لِّلۡمُتَّقِينَ<br>This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah</p><p>ٱلۡكِتَٰبُ&nbsp;<br>Kataba in modern Arabic means to write, but in old times pen was not very common. Back in the day people used to carve in stones or tablets and the problem with that is once you have written something then it is not possible for you to edit it. So by using the word Kitab. Allah reveals a profound knowledge that Quran is once set and there is no room for editting. So the order the placement and everything is how it is meant to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Difference between Quran and Kitab</p><figure class="table ck-widget ck-widget_with-selection-handle" contenteditable="false"><div class="ck ck-widget__selection-handle"><svg class="ck ck-icon ck-reset_all-excluded ck-icon_inherit-color" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M4 0v1H1v3H0V.5A.5.5 0 0 1 .5 0H4zm8 0h3.5a.5.5 0 0 1 .5.5V4h-1V1h-3V0zM4 16H.5a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V12h1v3h3v1zm8 0v-1h3v-3h1v3.5a.5.5 0 0 1-.5.5H12z"></path><path fill-opacity=".256" d="M1 1h14v14H1z"></path><g class="ck-icon__selected-indicator"><path d="M7 0h2v1H7V0zM0 7h1v2H0V7zm15 0h1v2h-1V7zm-8 8h2v1H7v-1z"></path><path fill-opacity=".254" d="M1 1h14v14H1z"></path></g></svg></div><table><tbody><tr><td class="ck-editor__editable ck-editor__nested-editable" role="textbox" contenteditable="true"><p><span class="ck-table-bogus-paragraph"><strong>Quran</strong></span></p><div class="ck-table-column-resizer"><br data-cke-filler="true"></div></td><td class="ck-editor__editable ck-editor__nested-editable" role="textbox" contenteditable="true"><p><span class="ck-table-bogus-paragraph"><strong>Kitab</strong></span></p><div class="ck-table-column-resizer"><br data-cke-filler="true"></div></td></tr><tr><td class="ck-editor__editable ck-editor__nested-editable" role="textbox" contenteditable="true"><p><span class="ck-table-bogus-paragraph">Quran comes from Qara'a which means to read out aloud.</span></p><div class="ck-table-column-resizer"><br data-cke-filler="true"></div></td><td class="ck-editor__editable ck-editor__nested-editable" role="textbox" contenteditable="true"><p><span class="ck-table-bogus-paragraph">Kitab means to write or carved out.</span></p><div class="ck-table-column-resizer"><br data-cke-filler="true"></div></td></tr><tr><td class="ck-editor__editable ck-editor__nested-editable" role="textbox" contenteditable="true"><p><span class="ck-table-bogus-paragraph">So when Allah say Quran it means something that is recited.

Like a doubt that bothers you.<br>For example, you see a car and you can't determine what model is then that is not رَيۡبَۛ.</p><p>لِّلۡمُتَّقِينَ (Al Mutaqeen) comes from word wiqaya.&nbsp;<br>Excessive hyper protection. Some kind of horse is called wiqaya horse. For instance when a horse loses it's horse shoe then it walk pretty carefully for the step it take because its feet have become sensitive.&nbsp;</p><p>There are 6 ways you can look into this ayah.</p><ol><li>Alif Laam Meem (Orientation). That is the Book (writing itself because Al-kitab is also masdar). The Laam is there to signify that there is no other book like the Quran. You haven't experience writing like this.</li><li>Alif Laam meen will be mubatad. And ذَٰلِكَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبُ will be the khabar meaning the name of the book.&nbsp;</li><li>Alif Laam Meem by itself. That is infact the book, meaning the humanity was waiting. The Jews and Christians were as though in Madina that that is the book you were waiting for. There is no doubt that that is the book that you were all waiting for.<br>&nbsp; هُدٗى لِّلۡمُتَّقِينَ&nbsp;</li><li>Another reading is everything together meaning that that is the book there is no doubt that there is guidance in it for the mutaqeen. That this book will definitely guide you.</li><li>هُدٗى لِّلۡمُتَّقِينَ (it is hal). The car is running (Hal) (The car runs → potential that it would run (adjective)). So it means that it is constantly guiding not that it has potential to guide. But it is hal that you would have problems in life and it will guide you in your specific moment as though it just came down.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>There are two principles:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;لَا رَيۡبَۛ فِيهِۛ → There is no room for doubt whatsoever in it. Doubt gets remove when you see a miracle. Like Musa A.S seperating water.The Quran is not miraculous for the eyes it is the miracle of the ears. The Quran is a miracle for the generations to come. With the previous nations the miracles died are one generation. It is not for every ear. You will find the miracle if you come looking for it. If you look deep dive in it then you will find a miracle in it. If you ponder (reflect) it then you will find a miracle in it. The first part of my relationship with the Quran is there is no doubt in it.</li><li>هُدٗى لِّلۡمُتَّقِينَ → The second part of my relationship with the Quran is it is guidance for those who try to protect themselves. Guidance for those who lost. It closely related to gift (Hidaya). This is not about intelectual, it is a spirtual relationship that a guide for the heart. Allah compares revelation with water. As you need water to survive. Similarly, you need revelation for your spirtual thirst. Every few hours we stand in salah.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>لِّلۡمُتَّقِينَ → This is a noun as oppose to verb since, verb are temporary and noun are permanent. So, Allah is suggesting that this is a group of people that always be there. There is a suggestion that the people of Taqwa can also include good non muslims. Who are cautious in there dealings and have certain characteristics that they can also benefit from this book if they come looking into it for guidance.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ayah - 3<br>ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤۡمِنُونَ بِٱلۡغَيۡبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقۡنَٰهُمۡ يُنفِقُونَ<br>Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them</p><p>ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤۡمِنُونَ بِٱلۡغَيۡبِ (Those who believe in the unseen)<br>In our times, we believe things that can be proven scientifically. But this philosphy falls over itself, like most of the human emotions are unseen like love, appreciation etc.&nbsp;<br>Allah uses the present tenses, it suggests continuaty, struggle meaning incomplete. This people have faith, means that they keeps working on their iman meaning their iman goes down and high. But they keep working to bring it back up.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What does it mean to believe in the unseen?</strong><br>There are things that we can't see like Allah, angels, the miracles. But, there is also something deep that they see a kind of reality that other people cannot see.<br>For example, when someone is backbitting someone people don't feel anything but a person with Iman will feel something in his heart. This is living iman in the unseen.<br>So, there is a difference between facts about Islam because (it is quantitative) but taqwa is qualitative or Iman in the unseen is qualitiative that is why there iman goes down and up.</p><p>One of the most important quality of iman in the unseen is hope. A true momin never gets depressed. No matter how hard time gets we should always have iman in Allah.<br><br data-cke-filler="true"></p><p>Now, when you have the reality of unseen how will you keep it refresh. So, the next part.</p><p>وَيُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ → They establish prayer. Establishing prayer means to pray together to establish prayer with other as well. So it means to go to the masjid and pray. There is difference between praying the prayer and establishing prayer. Salah comes from Silah which means connection.<br><br>وَمِمَّا رَزَقۡنَٰهُمۡ يُنفِقُونَ<br>Ma is more vastness. Whatever we provided them (like some people were provided with health, mind, money, sons daughters). so everyone rizq is different and the spend from that rizq tht Allah provided them.<br>Nafiqa is lizards hole. they would make two openings. if trouble is from one side then get out from the other. Similarly kings have holes (tunnel) from which they can get out if their castle gets invaded. So, this is the concept behind infaq. That we deposit in this world and we will get the return in the next life. The idea of spending in path of Allah means to spend and you will get return in the next life and this cannot be acheived if we not have believe in the unseeen.&nbsp;</p><p>وَمِمَّا رَزَقۡنَٰهُمۡ → Allah mentions we provided them because we forget that everything we have is given to us by Allah. Allah also uses past tense for Rizq. One benefit for this is that Allah has already given and we should not think when Allah will give then we will donate.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Ayah - 4<br>وَٱلَّذِينَ يُؤۡمِنُونَ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيۡكَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ مِن قَبۡلِكَ وَبِٱلۡأٓخِرَةِ هُمۡ يُوقِنُونَ<br>And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith]</p><p>Some scholar thinks that this is for some other group (People of the book).&nbsp;<br>Jews some centuries after Musa A.S became two groups one &nbsp;that did not believe in the hereafter and one group had some vague believe in the hereafter. So this ayah has a better appreciation when we have this background. So one of the most important believe in the unseen is of the afterlife. Becuse if it dwindles then other thing dwindles as well.</p>
